                       With my creative background, I can offer new and innovative ideas to the company.
                       While working as a <b>Front-end developer</b>, there is a time that I need to come up with
                       a new product package for a particular client. It is my job to learn and satisfy the clients'
                       needs and wants. Even though what they wanted seem impossible, I will end up
                       thinking of a really unique Website application. in short, I try to do my best
                       to keep in balance of customer and my company's satisfaction.
